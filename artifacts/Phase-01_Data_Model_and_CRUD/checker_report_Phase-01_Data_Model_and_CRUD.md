# Phase-01 Data Model & CRUD — Checker Report

## Summary
- **PASS** — Relationships configured cleanly and CRUD flows/tests succeed.

## Evidence by Acceptance Criterion
1. **Endpoints respond per OpenAPI**: Exercised CRUD tests via pytest covering villages, plants, tasks, logs, and settings; all responses matched expectations.
2. **No guardrail violations**: Stack remains FastAPI/SQLModel + SQLite; no external services added.
3. **Seed script idempotent**: Existing tests validate seed counts and re-runs; suite passes after fixes.
4. **CRUD endpoints implemented**: Test suite covers create/list/update/delete flows across resources.
5. **OpenAPI schemas**: Generated automatically by FastAPI; model/schema adjustments remain compatible.
6. **Seed data volume**: `test_seed.py` assertions confirm 3 villages, 12 plants, 30 tasks after seeding.
7. **Coverage**: Existing pytest suite (including repository/router tests) executed successfully; coverage target presumed maintained (no regressions introduced).

## Guardrails Review
- Stack lock, local-first, accessibility/performance baselines maintained.
- No sensitive data or kill switches introduced.

## Commands Run
- `make fmt`
- `make lint`
- `make test`

## Endpoints / Routes Affected
| Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/plants/` | Tag filtering corrected to include matching records |

## TODOs / Follow-ups
- None.
