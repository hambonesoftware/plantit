# Phase 02 — Media Pipeline — Checker Report

## Summary
- **Result:** PASS
- **Build/Test Evidence:** `pytest backend/tests/test_photos.py`

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. **Uploads store original + thumbnail with EXIF handling:** Verified via tests that confirm files exist after upload and are rotated using Pillow. (`test_upload_photo_success`).
2. **Validation of MIME type and size:** Tests cover unsupported media and oversized uploads returning 415/413 responses.
3. **Deletion removes DB row and files:** `test_delete_photo_removes_files` confirms cleanup on disk and in the database.
4. **Guardrails respected:** Stack remains FastAPI/SQLModel/SQLite with Pillow; no external services introduced; paths constrained to `backend/data/media`.
5. **Docs/Config:** Settings updated for media root and upload limits; temp paths configured in pytest fixtures.

## Guardrails Audit
- **Stack Lock:** Compliant (FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite + Pillow).
- **Local-First:** All media stored locally under `backend/data/media`.
- **Security:** Path traversal prevented; MIME type and size validated.
- **Testing:** Dedicated pytest module ensures regressions caught.

## Endpoints
