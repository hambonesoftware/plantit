# Phase 10 â€” Checker Report

## Summary
- **Result:** PASS
- Offline queue integration and service worker verified; mutations queue when offline and replay successfully on reconnect.

## Acceptance Criteria Evidence
- Request queue serializes JSON and FormData, retries with capped exponential backoff, and emits success events (`frontend/js/services/requestQueue.js`).
- API client defers POST/PATCH/DELETE to queue when offline or encountering server errors (`frontend/js/services/apiClient.js`).
- View models handle `queued` responses without throwing and refresh when queue drains (`frontend/js/viewmodels/*.js`).
- Service worker caches static assets and GET responses for offline shell (`frontend/js/pwa/sw.js`).
- Manual run: disable network, complete a task, observe queued toast, re-enable network, queue flush updates dashboard.

## Guardrails
- No new external dependencies; uses native browser APIs only.
- Offline messaging uses existing toast system; no kill switch added.

## Tests
- `pytest`
- `npm test`

## Endpoints
- No new endpoints.

## TODO
- None.
