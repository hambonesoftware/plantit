# Phase 04 — Dashboard Aggregates — Checker Report

## Summary
- **Result:** PASS
- **Build/Test Evidence:** `pytest backend/tests/test_dashboard.py`

## Acceptance Criteria Verification
1. **Villages rollups:** Test verifies plant counts, due-today, overdue, and cover photo selection per village.
2. **Today task list:** Response includes enriched plant/village refs for pending tasks due on the provided date.
3. **Mini-calendar:** Six-week window produced; test checks counts for today and tomorrow buckets.
4. **Last watered metric:** Calculated from latest watering logs; test asserts two-day delta.
5. **Guardrails:** Pure SQLModel/FastAPI implementation, no external services, fully local.

## Guardrails Audit
- **Stack Lock:** Compliant with Python 3.12 + FastAPI + SQLModel + SQLite.
- **Performance:** Aggregation uses in-memory computations on session query results; no N+1 remote calls.
- **Testing:** Dedicated pytest ensures deterministic output for fixed reference date.
