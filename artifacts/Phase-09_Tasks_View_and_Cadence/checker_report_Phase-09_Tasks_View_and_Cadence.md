# Phase 09 â€” Checker Report

## Summary
- **Result:** PASS
- Tasks workspace verified with filtering, batch completion/reschedule, and cadence engine responses.

## Acceptance Criteria Evidence
- `/api/v1/tasks` supports filtering and mutation without duplicates (unit tests in `backend/tests/test_tasks.py`).
- Cadence service handles daily/weekly intervals and is exercised via tests.
- Tasks view allows keyboard access to selection controls and batch actions.
- Completing or rescheduling tasks refreshes counts on Home and Village views (`frontend/js/viewmodels/HomeVM.js`, `frontend/js/viewmodels/VillageVM.js`).

## Guardrails
- Local-first: all interactions hit FastAPI/SQLite only.
- Accessibility: selection buttons labelled, focus preserved after bulk actions.

## Tests
- `pytest`
- `npm test`

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/tasks`
- `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id}`
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/batch`

## TODO
- None.
