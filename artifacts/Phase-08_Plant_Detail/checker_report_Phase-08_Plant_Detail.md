# Phase 08 â€” Checker Report

## Summary
- **Result:** PASS
- Plant detail experience verified with keyboard-accessible tabs, care profile editing, log creation, and photo upload/delete flows.

## Acceptance Criteria Evidence
- Tab interface announces proper roles and supports Arrow/Home/End navigation (manual inspection).
- Saving overview and care profile issues PATCH/PUT calls and updates metrics (`frontend/js/viewmodels/PlantVM.js`).
- Photo uploads render placeholders immediately and replace with server data on success (`frontend/js/viewmodels/PlantVM.js`).
- Backend endpoints return expected payloads (validated via `pytest`).

## Guardrails
- Stack remains FastAPI + SQLModel and vanilla JS modules. No third-party network calls introduced.
- Accessibility: tab controls expose ARIA attributes and keyboard shortcuts; forms labelled and focus managed.

## Tests
- `pytest`
- `npm test`

## Endpoints
- `GET /api/v1/plants/{id}`
- `PATCH /api/v1/plants/{id}`
- `PUT /api/v1/plants/{id}/care_profile`
- `GET /api/v1/plants/{id}/logs`
- `POST /api/v1/plants/{id}/logs`
- `POST /api/v1/plants/{id}/photos`
- `DELETE /api/v1/photos/{id}`
- `POST /api/v1/plants/{id}/tasks`

## TODO
- None.
