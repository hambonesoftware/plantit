# Phase 10 - Plants & Today Panel Read Path
**Objective:** Plants listing per village and the Today summary panel.

**Deliverables:**
- Backend: `GET /api/villages/{id}/plants`, `GET /api/today` (summaries).
- Frontend: `PlantListView` display; `TodayPanel` renders with polling off by default (manual refresh).

**Definition of Done:**
- Real data flows, with loading skeletons and empty states.
