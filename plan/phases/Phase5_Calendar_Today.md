## ✅ Phase 5 — Calendar & Today Panel

- [x] Today panel lists due and overdue tasks with checkbox completion that optimistically updates badges and calendar dots.
- [x] Mini calendar re-renders from shared dashboard state, reflecting completions and watering events immediately.
- [x] Panel supports collapse preference (stored via `store.js`) and re-fetches `/api/vm/today` after task completion.
