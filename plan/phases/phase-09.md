# Phase 09 - Villages Read Path
**Objective:** List & detail for villages.

**Deliverables:**
- Backend: `GET /api/villages`, `GET /api/villages/{id}`.
- Frontend: `VillageListView` and `VillageDetailView` with navigation via hash router.
- Ensure SPA fallback route still works for deep links.

**Definition of Done:**
- Clicking a village shows its details; deep URL reload works.
