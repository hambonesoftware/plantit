# Phase 04 - MVVM Contracts & Module Skeleton
**Objective:** Define frontal VM interfaces and backend VM/service boundaries.

**Deliverables:**
- `docs/mvvm-contracts.md` specifying View â†” ViewModel events/data per view (Dashboard, Villages, Today, Plant Modal).
- Backend service interfaces (Python protocols or ABCs) for read paths.
- Frontend service layer wrapper with fetch helpers and error taxonomy.

**Definition of Done:**
- Contracts reviewed and checked into repo.
- Stub VMs compile with TS JSDoc typings (or *.d.ts) even in ESM-JS context.
