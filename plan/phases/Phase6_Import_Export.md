## ✅ Phase 6 — Import/Export

- [x] `/api/export` streams a consolidated JSON bundle with villages, plants, tasks, and logs using ISO-8601 timestamps.
- [x] `/api/import` performs schema validation, supports a dry-run preview, and merges existing rows by id or creates new ones.
- [x] Dashboard footer buttons trigger download/upload flows with accessible status messaging and refresh the UI after import.
