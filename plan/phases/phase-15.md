# Phase 15 - E2E & Load Tests
**Objective:** Confidence before release.

**Deliverables:**
- Playwright E2E: first paint test, deep-link test, CRUD flows.
- Locust/k6 simple load against read endpoints.
- Regression suite in CI (local GitHub Actions runner acceptable).

**Definition of Done:**
- Green E2E; smoke load passes; artifacts saved to /artifacts.
