# Phase 11 - Write Paths & Transactional UI
**Objective:** Add/Create/Edit/Delete with optimistic UI and rollback.

**Deliverables:**
- Backend: POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints for Villages and Plants with validation.
- Frontend: Forms with client-side validation; optimistic updates with rollback if server fails.
- Concurrency notes in responses (etag or updated_at) to prevent overwrites.

**Definition of Done:**
- Common mutation flows tested end-to-end.
