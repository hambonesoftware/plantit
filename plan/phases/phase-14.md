# Phase 14 - Performance Budgets & Code Splitting
**Objective:** Enforce first paint and bundle-size ceilings.

**Deliverables:**
- Budget: TTI < 1.5s local, initial JS < 50KB gzipped.
- Deferral of non-critical modules; code-splitting via dynamic import.
- Image policy and preconnect/preload hints.

**Definition of Done:**
- Budgets pass locally; perf checklist committed.
