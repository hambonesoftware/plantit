# Phase 08 - Dashboard Read Path
**Objective:** Wire dashboard view in read-only mode.

**Deliverables:**
- Backend: `/api/dashboard` aggregates data needed for dashboard cards.
- Frontend: `DashboardViewModel` fetches and renders cards with loading and error states.

**Definition of Done:**
- Skeleton cards render real data from DB.
- Network failure shows a friendly error panel and a retry button.
