# QA_Tester
**Goal:** Tests for backend and smoke for frontend.
- Backend: pytest cases for CRUD, due/overdue logic, import/export.
- Frontend: pytest-playwright smoke (optional headless) to click through dashboard and complete a task.

**Acceptance:** All tests pass locally (offline). CI optional if available.
