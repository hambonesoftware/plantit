# Agent Phase 04 â€” MVVM Contracts & Module Skeleton

## Objective
Define MVVM contracts and backend service interfaces.

## File Operations
- Create `docs/mvvm-contracts.md` with events and data per view (Dashboard, Villages, Today, Plant Modal).
- Create `backend/services/contracts.py` with Protocols/ABCs for read paths.
- Create `frontend/services/api.js` with `request()` helper, error taxonomy, and correlation id injection.

## Commands to Run
Open and review docs; no runtime changes required yet.

## Verification / Definition of Done
Contracts file present and referenced; stubs compile.

## Rollback Plan
Delete contracts if blocking progress; keep plan docs intact.

## Notes
This phase is docs-first to prevent shape drift later.
